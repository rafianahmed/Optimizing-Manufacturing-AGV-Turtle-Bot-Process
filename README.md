# Robotics-Final-Project-Optimizing-Manufacturing-Process-at-ISYSE-KAIST

Introduction:
In collaboration with my team at ISYSE, KAIST, I spearheaded a transformative project in robotics aimed at revolutionizing the manufacturing process. Tasked with streamlining the production of 'Product Z,' a critical automotive panel component, our endeavor involved the strategic utilization of a mobile robot to navigate through various stages of production seamlessly.

Project Scope:
The project centered on the meticulous orchestration of manufacturing operations, from raw material processing to final product delivery. Leveraging cutting-edge robotics technology and ROS (Robot Operating System), we meticulously mapped out the shop floor layout and devised a comprehensive strategy to optimize workflow efficiency.

Key Objectives:
Our primary objectives encompassed not only the successful execution of the manufacturing process but also the rigorous analysis of key performance metrics to drive continuous improvement. These objectives included:

Efficient Operation: Programmed the robot motion to facilitate the manufacturing of five 'Product Z' units, ensuring smooth transition between stations while providing real-time feedback on the robot's position.

Performance Metrics: Calculated essential parameters such as Average Cycle Time for 'Part A' and 'Part B,' Average Cycle Time for 'Product Z,' Throughput Rate for each machine, Work in Progress (WIP), Total Completion Time, Machine Utilization, and identified bottlenecks for targeted enhancements.

Documentation and Presentation: Produced a comprehensive work report detailing our process optimization strategies, along with a captivating video showcasing the manufacturing process. Additionally, delivered a dynamic 10-minute presentation elucidating our project methodology and outcomes.

Innovative Approach:
Our approach involved a meticulous blend of software development, robotics engineering, and data analysis. By harnessing the power of ROS packages and the move_base action library, we orchestrated the seamless movement of the robot throughout the manufacturing floor, maximizing operational efficiency.

Impact and Future Prospects:
Our project not only showcased our technical prowess but also underscored our commitment to driving tangible outcomes in real-world settings. Moving forward, we envision further refinements to our manufacturing process, leveraging insights gleaned from performance metrics to continuously enhance system efficiency and productivity.

Conclusion:
The Robotics Final Project at ISYSE, KAIST represents a testament to our team's ingenuity, collaboration, and dedication to excellence. By reimagining traditional manufacturing paradigms through the lens of robotics and automation, we've laid the groundwork for a future where innovation and efficiency converge seamlessly.
